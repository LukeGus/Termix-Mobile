Requires a Termix server - install at https://docs.termix.site/install

Take full remote control of your servers with Termix, the ultimate SSH terminal management tool. Connect to your existing Termix server configuration and manage all your SSH hosts with terminal capability.

Secure Authentication:
2FA/TOTP multi-factor authentication support secures your connections. Secure JWT token-based authentication with password and SSH key authentication support is used in the app. Account registration is activated when your server administrator enables it, giving you complete control over access management.

Terminal Experience:
Experience a full-featured SSH terminal with xterm.js integration and multi-session terminal support, which are easily managed through an intuitive tabbing interface. Real-time connection status tracking keeps you informed about the status of your servers, and auto-reconnect with intelligent retry ensures your sessions stay connected. Terminal resize handling is automatically managed according to your screen size for best fit.

Advanced Keyboard Features:
Switch between two keyboard modes, the system keyboard and a custom terminal keyboard that is optimized for terminal use. The custom keyboard provides function keys (F1-F12), nav keys, and all the basic terminal shortcuts. Modifier key support (Ctrl, Alt) for all your favorite terminal commands and built-in shortcuts such as Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D, Ctrl+Z, and Ctrl+L for invoking common actions quickly. Paste from the clipboard and sticky keyboard focus provide seamless workflow.

Host Management:
Organize your servers with folder-based host management and see real-time server status with visual indicators for Online, Offline, or Unknown status. Animated ping effects provide immediate visual feedback on connection health. Filter and search hosts by name, IP address, or username to quickly get to what you need. Single-tap SSH connection to any host streamlines your workflow, and host tagging and categorization ensure large server lists are easy to manage.

Mobile-Optimized Interface:
The application has a dark theme that is tailored for terminal work with a responsive layout that fits any screen size. Pull-to-refresh capability maintains host status updates in real-time, and easy tab-based navigation allows seamless switching between hosts. The gesture-supported interface design provides flawless performance on touch-based devices.

Server Configuration:
Easy server configuration with auto connection testing validates your setup before saving. Support for both HTTP and HTTPS server connections via automatic server URL normalization ensures compatibility. Version compatibility checking prevents connection issues, while secure server configuration storage protects your settings.

Performance and Reliability:
Real-time communication using WebSocket provides instant responsiveness, while efficient memory management handles multiple sessions without performance degradation.
